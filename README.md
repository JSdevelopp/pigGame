# In this project, I created a fun interactive web app game that uses DOM manipulation to combine all logic for JavaScript, design using some basic but dynamic CSS properties, and showing both files interact with HTML.
# In this project, I experimented with how to use both basic and advanced DOM manipulations to add, edit, and update features for both CSS properties or JavaScript logic. 

# This project helped me learn fundamentals in using class names, id's, and various componenets to creating a working web app. Most notably, I was able to learn the logic flow of when users are rolling a die and how do I take that number they rolled to add onto the scoreboard.

# For each files in this project, I added comments for structure and why each piece of code is there.

# I added a dynamic background to when users win,loses, and players switch turns, the background of the web app changes accordinng to the respective action and response. Overall, the most important thing I learned from this project was working with logic and data flow. The project contains a flowchart of logic that explains each actions or response of events of the game.



# Gameplay - 
# Users can play this game with one or two people, where whoever clicks and rolls their dices till 100 points first, wins the game. However there is a catch! if any player rolls a 1, they will reset their scoreboard to 0, and then the other player gets to roll. Players can choose to hold their current score or gamble for a potential win!
# The game has a working reset button to play again, and in addition, a basic scoreboard to hold points.
